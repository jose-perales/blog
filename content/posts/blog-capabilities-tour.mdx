# Blog Capabilities Tour

This post exists to showcase what this blog can do today:

- Rich Markdown (headings, lists, links, tables)
- MDX prose with readable typography
- Code blocks with Shiki highlighting (including titles)
- Line highlighting for callouts
- Inline code styling like `npm test` and `prisma migrate dev`

## Links, lists, and blockquotes

A link should feel calm and readable: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

> Blockquotes should read like marginalia.
> They should stay quiet and legible.

### A small GFM table

| Capability              | Status |
| ----------------------- | ------ |
| MDX posts in-repo       | Yes    |
| Syntax highlighting     | Yes    |
| Auth / likes / comments | Yes    |

## Inline code in headings: `rehype-pretty-code`

Inline code should be distinct without shouting.

- In lists: run `npm run dev` locally
- In lists: check `npm run build` before pushing

## TypeScript example (with title)

```ts title="lib/capabilities.ts"
export type Capability = {
  name: string;
  implemented: boolean;
};

export const capabilities: Capability[] = [
  { name: "MDX rendering", implemented: true },
  { name: "Syntax highlighting", implemented: true },
  { name: "Auth + engagement", implemented: true },
];
```

## Line highlighting

```ts {3,7} title="lib/highlight-demo.ts"
export function formatSummary(title: string, items: string[]) {
  const safeTitle = title.trim();

  // A very long line to verify horizontal scroll works as intended on overflow and doesn’t wrap unexpectedly:
  const joined = items
    .map((i) => i.trim())
    .filter(Boolean)
    .join(" · ");

  return `${safeTitle}: ${joined}`;
}
```

## CSS example (tokens and spacing)

```css title="app/globals.css"
.mdx figure[data-rehype-pretty-code-figure] {
  /* This block is intentionally here as a visual target for code styling */
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
}
```

## SQL example

```sql title="prisma/query.sql"
SELECT
  p.slug,
  p."viewCount",
  COUNT(pl.id) AS like_count
FROM "Post" p
LEFT JOIN "PostLike" pl ON pl."postId" = p.id
GROUP BY p.slug, p."viewCount"
ORDER BY p."viewCount" DESC;
```

## Shell example

```bash title="Terminal"
npm run lint
npm test
npm run dev
```
